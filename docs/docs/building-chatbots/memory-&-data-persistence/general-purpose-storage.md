--------------------

What if the four types of storage don't fulfill my requirements? Don't worry; we still have other options!

The **Key-Value Store** is a general-purpose store that allows you to store any data. You will need to manage expirations and data update yourself since Mlchain will not update these values independently.

The KVS is available from the [Mlchain SDK](https://mlchain.com/reference/modules/_mlchain_sdk_.kvs.html).
